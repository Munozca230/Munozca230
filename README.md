Hey, I'm Jos√© Miguel. I'm currently preparing my self to become a software developer.
One of my biggest passions is to learn new things every day, especially new code (for the moment I'm trying to become a backend developer, but later I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna become a full stack developer).
I'm a from Colombia so my principal lenguage is Spanish but I also like a lot English, my goal is to push my vocabulary and pronunciation to the most advanced level.
